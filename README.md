## Summary
When the "silver tsunami" comes Pewlett Hackard will lose over 90 thousand roles leaving a massive hole in their work force
A table that may prove useful is a table showing the percentage of roles compared to the entire workforce and total of those roles at the company
There is less than 2000 total retirement-ready employees that are qualified to mentor the next generation. Compared to the total workforce, that is not nearly enough to sustain
the entire company. A good table to show this relationship would be the amount of employees with entry level roles vs mentorship senior role equivalents and their percentage
compared to the total workforce.
